## 1. Database

### 1.1 What is a Database?

A database is like a digital warehouse where we store and organize information. It's a special place in a computer where we keep data, like names, numbers, and facts, so we can easily find and use them.

### 1.2 Why Do We Use Databases?

We use databases to keep our information safe and organized. Think of it like a giant digital bookshelf. It helps us quickly find what we need and ensures that our data doesn't get mixed up or misplaced.

### 1.3 How Does a Database Work?

1. **Tables:** In a database, we use tables to organize our data. Tables are like spreadsheets with rows and columns. Each table has a specific purpose, like storing information about people or products.
2. **Records:** Rows in a table are called records. Each record contains a set of related information. For example, a record about a person might include their name, age, and address.

3. **Fields:** Columns in a table are called fields. Fields represent the different pieces of information we want to store. In a table about people, fields could be things like "Name," "Age," and "Address."
4. **Queries:** To get data from a database, we use queries. Queries are like questions we ask the database. For instance, we might ask, "Show me all the customers who bought products in the last month."

### Examples of Databases:

- **Customer Database:** A database that stores information about customers, like their names, contact details, and purchase history.

- **Library Database:** A database that keeps track of books, their authors, and who has borrowed them.

- **Inventory Database:** A database used by stores to manage their stock of products, such as clothes or electronics.

## 2 Query Language

### 2.1 What is a Query Language?

A query language is a special way of talking to a computer or a database to ask it for information or perform actions. It's like having a conversation with a computer in a language it understands.

Imagine your data is like a big library full of books. Each book has lots of information, and you want to find specific details quickly. Query language is your detective tool.

### 2.2 Why Do We Use Query Languages?

We use query languages to communicate with computers or databases because they need specific instructions to find, sort, or change data. Instead of using regular words, we use a structured set of commands to make our requests.
